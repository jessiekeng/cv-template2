# Hi, I'm Jessie Keng 👋 

### Data Science Student | AI Infrastructure & Full-Stack Developer
**Sunway University Entrance Scholarship Recipient | 3.9 CGPA**

I am a specialized Data Science student focused on the intersection of **AI Infrastructure** and **Scalable Software Engineering**. From building high-performance MCP servers to engineering RAG-based chatbots, I specialize in making data actionable through modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Featured Tech: GitHub Intelligence MCP
I recently developed a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server that bridges LLMs with real-time GitHub data. 
* **The Twist:** It doesn't just fetch data; it performs **Feature Engineering** on the fly, calculating repository "Health Scores" and activity velocity to give AI agents deeper context.
* **Stack:** Node.js, Zod, MCP SDK, Axios.
